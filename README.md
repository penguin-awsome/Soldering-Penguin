# Soldering-Penguin
A Hackclub project where you design a PCB that will do something cool and get it + an eletronics kit. This is not the project, just my submission.

I decided to make my life hell with a penguin who stares at you menacingly and makes your life hell with flashing alternating lights and vibration at certain times of the day. It was cool to make and I think it should work. in the long term, I'm not sure if it actually working would be good for my sleep schedule but oh well.

I cutout the edgecuts with straight lines by hand which was probably not a good way to do it but oh well.
